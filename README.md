# OBJKT
Built a object detector app with the help OpenCV 2 library.
Used pre-trained data models for face as well as object recognition use cases.
Implemented the UI using the Tkinter library for live webcam view and info.
The app is also able to save the timestamps of the object interference in a CSV file using basic read and write method
